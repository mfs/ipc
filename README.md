## ipc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mfs/ipc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mfs/ipc)

A simple clone of ipcalc in Rust. Written to get a feel for the language. Needs
cleaning up here and there and I have a couple of ideas for extra features.

It builds with the latest nightly release. Let me know if it doesn't build with
the latest nightly or if you find any bugs.

To build use `cargo`:

```
cargo build
```
